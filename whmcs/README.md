WHMCS Clientarea Bootstrap Template
=============

Clientarea template for use with the WHMCS billing software



Features
-----------

A few features that sets this template apart from the default WHMCS template.

* HTML is clean and valid
* Includes full version of Twitter-Bootstrap (css, javascript and images)
* Responsive design - this means the template will adjust and look great as well as being usable on devices other than desktop computers (ex: smartphones, tablets, and large displays).


Goal
-----------

My main goal with this project is to keep up-to-date with the latest releases of both twitter-bootstrap and WHMCS.
